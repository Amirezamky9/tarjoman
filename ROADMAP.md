# Tarjoman Production Roadmap

**Roadmap revision:** TARJOMAN-RM-3
**Architecture:** TARJOMAN-A0-PROD-3
**Date:** 2026-09-21
**Status:** OWNER_FREEZE_CANDIDATE
**Immutable upstream baseline:** `58e97b802aa3efb318135a5923231c0a08550c4a`

This roadmap is generated conceptually from the same work-package contract stored in `WORKPACKAGES.json`. The JSON registry is the machine-readable execution source; this file is the human-readable view.

## Execution law

- Do not begin a package until every `depends_on` package is `DONE` or the owner explicitly records a dependency waiver via ADR/roadmap change.
- One Work Package per PR by default.
- Package scope is the named deliverable plus acceptance criteria; unrelated cleanup is out of scope.
- A package is not DONE until all acceptance items have evidence.
- Architecture-impacting ambiguity follows the ADR stop rule in `AGENTS.md`.
- Core v1 packages are marked **YES** below; ASR/TTS/UI/A2A packages may proceed later/parallel when dependencies permit.

## Critical path

```text
Architecture freeze
   -> Foundation
      -> Translation
         -> Evaluation + core formats
            -> Application facade + MCP
               -> Core release hardening -> Core v1.0

Foundation also unlocks independent ASR and TTS tracks.
UI depends on stable API contracts. A2A is optional after MCP/app contracts.
```

# Release-track gates

## Core v1.0
All packages with `required_for_core_v1=true` must be DONE. Core v1 does not wait for ASR, TTS, UI, or A2A.

## ASR capability
ASR-001..012 plus applicable REL security/license/recovery evidence must be DONE before ASR is advertised production-ready.

## TTS capability
TTS-001..017 packages applicable to the chosen engine plus TTS license/evaluation/release evidence must be DONE before TTS is advertised production-ready.

## UI / A2A
Ship independently after their dependencies and capability-specific review gates pass.

# Deferred infrastructure
Redis, Celery, Kafka, Postgres, Kubernetes, distributed schedulers, third-party plugin ABI, application-level encrypted workspaces, exact PDF reconstruction, and custom model training require evidence + ADR before entering an active package.
